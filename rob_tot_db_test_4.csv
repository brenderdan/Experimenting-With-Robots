This was the first time in Japan that a drone was used to deliver supplies in a mountainous region where the difference in altitude between takeoff and landing locations reached approximately 1600m. Hakuba, a popular winter sports destination for tourists in Japan, faces significant challenges in transporting supplies between mountain huts. Currently staff either carry supplies on foot or have them delivered via helicopter. The cost of the trips, however, is rising sharply and helicopters cannot be used under poor weather conditions. Trials were conducted from mid-August to mid-September along a route that is approximately 5km long, from Sarukuraso (1,250m above sea level) at the foot of Mountain Shirouma (2,932m) in Hakuba, to one of Japans highest mountain huts, Hakuba Sanso (2,832m), at the summit and the Hakubadake Chojoshukusha hut (2,730m). Implementing drones shrunk delivery time to around 15 minutes, as compared to traveling seven hours by foot. The drone delivered peaches, pears, and other supplies weighing up to 5kg from the foot of the mountain to the destination without tarnishing their quality.","1. <a href=https://jdcorporateblog.com/jds-drones-completed-trial-delivery-in-japans-mountainous-region/>Link</a>"
